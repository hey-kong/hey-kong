### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a 1st year Ph.D. student from School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. Jiguang Wan.
My research interests focus on computing and storage systems in cloud and edge environments, including: (1) data management; (2) edge-cloud collaborative computing systems; (3) computing and storage systems atop novel network/storage infrastructures (e.g., DPU).
