### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a 3rd year Master student from PDSL group in Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology supervised by Prof. Jiguang Wan.
My current research interests focus on distributed systems that span multiple geographic areas and infrastructures, including cloud and edge environments.
