### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a 3rd year Master student from PDSL group in Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. Jiguang Wan.
My research interests focus on computing and storage systems in cloud and edge environments, including: (1) data management; (2) edge-cloud collaborative computing systems; (3) computing and storage systems atop novel network/storage infrastructures (e.g., DPU).
