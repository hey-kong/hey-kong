### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Jiguang Wan.
My research interests focus on data management, storage systems, and edge computing, with particular interests in workload analysis, efficient storage, novel network/storage infrastructures (e.g., DPU), and resource-efficient system design.
